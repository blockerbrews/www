My name is BlockerBrews and I've been brewing professionally since 2014 in Busan, South Korea. I began my brewing adventures homebrewing in my tiny studio apartment in 2012. That hobby grew and grew until a local startup brewery tapped me to work in the brewery. After about 2 years I stepped up into the head brewer role where I've been toiling away since.

This site is a place for me to record discoveries, share knowledge, or tell stories about my brewing experiences.
